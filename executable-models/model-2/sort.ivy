# For some reason the following properties aren't implied by the 'interpret'

# Notable: it seems to work without these properties if we pass 'complete=qf'
# but we .. don't necessarily always want to do that?

# Simply comparing a node with 0, 1, 2 would not work because of
# error: Cannot cast "0:id_t" to native sort id_t
# See https://github.com/kenmcmil/ivy/issues/15
